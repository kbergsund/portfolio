        <p className='long-bio'>I started my career in music festival production because I am passionate about facilitating meaningful experiences for broad audiences. I love being part of a team that fabricates joy. Now, as a software engineer, I continue that work by actively contributing to the creation of impactful products. Iâ€™m focused on the intersections of impactful immersive tech, human connection, and sustainability. Specializing in front-end engineering with experience in React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS/Sass, I bring my eagerness to never stop learning, my enjoyment of solving problems in innovative ways, and my strengths in methodical organization and proactive communication to every team.
        <br /><br />
        As an outdoor enthusiast, I am excited by the potential for software products to bring people together and to increase access to outdoor education, recreation, and sustainable living. I believe it is an avenue that will in turn inspire people to care more for each other and the world we live in.</p>
